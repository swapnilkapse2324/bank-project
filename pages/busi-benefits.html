        <h3>1. Flexibility for usage</h3><br>
        <li>Unlike equity investors, lenders like banks and NBFCs don’t interfere with how you run your business. They don’t dictate how you should use the business loan money; they’re just concerned with timely repayments. Therefore, a business loan is the best option to retain full control over how you spend funds.</li><br>
       
        <hr>
    
        <h3>2. Convenient and easy</h3><br>
        <li>Getting a business loan is as easy as getting in touch with a lender and talking about the possibility of securing financing. As opposed to looking for investors and holding discussions that take months at end, getting a business loan is convenient and far more straightforward.</li><br>
        <hr>
    
        <h3>3. Reasonable interest rates</h3><br>
        <li>Most lenders offer reasonable interest rates on business loans, as opposed to other types of loans—the reason being, cutthroat competition among lending institutions for customers’ attention</li>
        <hr>
    
        <h3> 4. No sharing of profits</h3><br>
        
        <li> If you want to understand what your monthly repayments will look like, use a simple online tool such as the business loan EMI calculator.</li>
       <li>If you want to understand what your monthly repayments will look like, use Tata Capital’s business loan EMI calculator available online on our website</li>
        <hr>
    
        <h3>5.No collateral required</h3><br> 
        <li>Business loans are usually offered without demanding any collateral, provided you meet the eligibility criteria. Because business loans are unsecured, they are an especially attractive option for small businesses that may not possess a lot of assets</li><br>
        <hr>
    
        <h3>6. Working capital support
        </h3><br>
        <li> You can use the business loan money to increase your working capital, which can be a big help if you have a liquidity crunch. You can run daily operations and cover short-term expenses without having to dip into the emergency fund.</li><br>
        <hr>
    
        
        <h3>7. Tax benefits</h3><br>
        <li>The interest payable on a business loan is often tax-deductible. Check the interest limit and eligibility before you apply for business loan.</li><br>
