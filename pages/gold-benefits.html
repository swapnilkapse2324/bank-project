        <h3>1. Secured Loan benefits</h3><br>
        <li>Most Loans are either secured or unsecured. Unsecured loans require no collateral, but you have to fulfil stringent eligibility criteria. Since a Gold loan is a secured loan, lenders require collateral. However, they typically sanction the loan easily. You do not have to show income proof to obtain high-value loans. Plus, lenders levy a lower interest rate due to the pledged gold.</li><br>

        <h3>2. â€¢ No need for credit score</h3><br>
        <li>The only condition you need to comply with when you apply for a Gold Loan is that you must possess gold in the form of, coins, jewellery, etc. You can obtain the loan even if your credit score is low. In fact, many Gold Loan lenders do not insist on credit scores, contributing to the immense popularity of these loans.</li><br>

        <h3>3.  Reusing the same gold repeatedly</h3><br>
        <li>Once you have repaid and got back your Gold, you can use the same gold to obtain another loan. Since the Gold Loan amount is based on the gold's market value, you can even get a higher loan amount if the gold price rises.</li>

        <h3> 4. No sharing of profits</h3><br>
        
        <li> Once you have repaid and got back your Gold, you can use the same gold to obtain another loan. Since the Gold Loan amount is based on the gold's market value, you can even get a higher loan amount if the gold price rises.</li>
      
        <hr>
    
        <h3>5.Flexible repayment terms</h3><br> 
        <li>Gold Loans are not amortized, i.e., you need not pay the interest component and principal amount in every EMI. Instead, you may only repay the interest component in EMIs during the loan tenure and pay off the principal loan amount as a lump sum when the loan matures. This attribute makes a Gold Loan an excellent, pocket-friendly option. Moreover, you can also prepay the principal amount partially during the loan tenure and reduce your interest amount.</li><br>
