</div>

<div class="Terms">


    <h3>Interest Rate </h3>
    <li>Interest rates are of two types, variable and fixed. Taking loans with fixed interest rates ensures that your monthly instalments for repaying the loan are fixed. Getting Business Loan with variable interest rates could be difficult to manage as EMIs could increase if the rate increases.</li><br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Amortisation</h3>
    <li>This helps borrowers to understand how their loan payments are distributed. Payments made in the early stage allow banks to get the interest whereas later EMIs are more focused on recovering the principal amount. Longer loan repayment duration has low EMIs but the overall interest increases, thus choose the tenure that suits you the best.</li><br>
<hr>
<h3>Collateral</h3>
<li>Taking a loan against a collateral will help you get a secured Business Loan. These provide you with more suitable Business Loan terms and conditions. However, in case of a default in repayment, the collateral will be seized.</li>
