        <h3>Price of gold in the market</h3>
        <li>If the price of gold is high in the market, the value of the gold ornaments or coins being pledged by you will also be high. Lenders will offer you a lower interest rate in such cases since the risk associated is low and if ,for some reason, you are unable to make the equated monthly instalments (EMIs), the lender can easily recover the outstanding amount by selling/auctioning the gold ornaments.</li><br>
       <hr>
        <h3>Inflation</h3>
        <li>If the rate of inflation is high, the value of currency depreciates and hence, people tend to accumulate more gold. Gold acts as a hedge against inflationary conditions especially when they persist for a longer period. This, in turn, pushes the prices of gold higher and in such times if you wish to avail a gold loan, you may get lower interest rates from lenders.</li><br>
        <hr>
        <h3>Relationship with the bank</h3>
        <li> Most lenders offer gold loans to their existing customers, though, in some cases, individuals who have no history with the bank can also avail gold loans. However, existing customers of banks/lending institutions are typically in a better position to negotiate for a lower interest rate.</li><br>
